# visu-vola
GUI volatility2 . python

This is a personal project to make a visual interface compatible with volatility 2

It shamelessly uses code from copilot chat-gpt4 , stackoverflow, amd chtulhu inspired dreams, my python knowledge fits in a thimble.

If you have suggestions I will soon enable a feedback email.

The project should be able to run under win or linux ( check paths beacuse I have not doublechecked that all use os.pathing )
It should check if you have all the required needs ( python 3 and 2.7 since volatility2 requires python 2.7, python dependencies etc)


I hope to make a proper readme in the future.
